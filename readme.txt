# Multi-Agent DeepSeek Project

## Project Overview

This project is a multi-agent system that uses DeepSeek R1 1.5b along with advanced NLP tools to enable autonomous conversation among several specialized AI agents. The system utilizes:

- **DeepSeek R1 1.5b** for generating responses via the Ollama CLI.
- **SentenceTransformer ("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")** for generating semantic embeddings.
- **FAISS** for vector-based semantic search.
- **SQLite** for storing learned knowledge.
- **Asyncio** for asynchronous processing.
- **Python's logging module** to log all interactions and errors to `agents.log`.

The specialized agents include:
- **Omega AI** (Master Coordinator)
- **Logic AI** (Reasoning & Problem-Solving)
- **Philosopher AI** (Existential Thinking)
- **Scientist AI** (Theoretical Research)
- **Strategist AI** (Future Predictions)
- **Creative AI** (Creative)
- **Data Analyst AI** (Data Analysis & Insights)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```cmd
   cd C:\Users\Deven\deepseek_project
   ```
2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```cmd
   env\Scripts\activate
   ```
   *(You should see `(env)` at the start of your prompt.)*
3. **Install required packages:**
   ```cmd
   pip install numpy faiss-cpu sentence-transformers
   ```
4. **Run the project:**
   ```cmd
   python agents.py
   ```

## Observations (as of 2025-02-22)

- **Conversation Flow:**  
  The system completed 5 rounds of autonomous conversation. All specialized agents participated and exchanged responses as expected.

- **Agent Performance:**  
  - *Omega AI, Scientist AI, Philosopher AI, Logic AI, and Strategist AI* successfully retrieved their topics from memory.
  - *Creative AI* proposed engaging new topics, including "The Art of Embracing Dead Space" and "The Impact of Virtual Reality on Creativity."
  - *Data Analyst AI* provided a detailed overview of "Data Analysis Methods."
  - Some responses (e.g., for "Quantum Computing") encountered timeouts ("DeepSeek R1 32b request timed out"), indicating areas for further tuning.

- **Database Insights:**  
  The SQLite database (`ai_knowledge.db`) currently stores the following topics:
  1. Singularity Theory
  2. Quantum Computing
  3. The Nature of Consciousness
  4. The Laws of Logic and Reasoning
  5. Predicting Future Technological Trends
  6. Creative Idea Generation
  7. Data Analysis Methods

- **Error Handling:**  
  The system's retry mechanism was effective in most cases, though occasional timeouts were noted.

## Future Enhancements

- **Embedding Generation:**  
  Experiment with alternative SentenceTransformer models (e.g., "all-mpnet-base-v2") to improve semantic embeddings.

- **Conversation Logic:**  
  Refine context switching to allow more dynamic topic transitions and smoother dialogue.

- **Agent Roles:**  
  Expand or further refine specialized agent roles based on observed performance.

- **User Interface:**  
  Develop a simple web interface (e.g., using Flask) for real-time monitoring of conversations.

- **Performance Metrics:**  
  Enhance logging to include response times and resource usage for further optimization.

## Version History

- **Version 1.0 (2025-02-22):**  
  Initial implementation with asynchronous processing, enhanced vector generation via SentenceTransformer, context switching, specialized agent roles, and logging integration.
